# Git updater
[![dgit-updater](https://github.com/Bensuperpc/git-updater/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Bensuperpc/git-updater/actions/workflows/main.yml)

I developed a script in Python 3 to download and update a local git repository (with submodules), the advantage of this script is  it can update several git repositories without having to download everything (if the deposit is almost up to date).

It is also able to initialize a git and to download everything automatically thanks to the list of the depots (in the source code for the moment).
